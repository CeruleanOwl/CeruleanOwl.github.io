## Task

For my computer science capstone, I am tasked with finding flaws/enhancing previous projects and creating fundamentally more sound deliverables for those projects. 

## My Project choices

The projects chosen for this ePortfolio are meant to encapsulate many skills I have learned as a student at SNHU and to further demonstrate
my ability to learn and grow as a developer. There were 3 previous projects that were all finals in courses taken at SNHU and I have further
enhanced their uses beyond the scope of each of their respective classes to enhance security, demonstrate best practices, utilitize appropriate
algorithms/data structures, and implement features while managing trade-offs


## Original Artifact 1

Artifact 1 was originally used for IT - 145. The original specification documents mentioned that having cats implemented into the system could be a possibility in the future. Due to the OOP nature of this project, these implementations will add to the complexity of the design. I also had noticed that the terminal menu could be confusing and the output was not often noticed as being the end of a branching path. Creating a more readable menu for the user while allowing the user to understand when a branching path had been concluded would also need to be a priority, for this enhancement, along with the inclusion of cat functionalities.
