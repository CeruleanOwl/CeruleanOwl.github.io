## My Project

The projects chosen for this ePortfolio are meant to encapsulate many skills I have learned as a student at SNHU and to further demonstrate
my ability to learn and grow as a developer. There were 3 previous projects that were all finals in courses taken at SNHU and I have further
enhanced their uses beyond the scope of each of their respective classes to enhance security, demonstrate best practices, utilitize appropriate
algorithms/data structures, and implement features while managing trade-offs
